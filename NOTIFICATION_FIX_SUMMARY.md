# Notification System Fix: Unread Messages on Sign-In

## Problem
When users signed in, they didn't see unread messages in the notifications dropdown. Notifications only appeared for real-time messages received while the user was already signed in.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **NotificationContext** only loaded notifications from `localStorage` and listened for real-time socket events
2. No mechanism existed to fetch existing unread messages from the server when a user signed in
3. Dashboard API already fetched unread messages but this data wasn't used for notifications
4. Only an endpoint for unread message count existed (`/api/messages/unread-count`) but no endpoint to fetch actual unread messages for notifications

## Solution Implemented

### 1. New Backend API Endpoint
**File**: `backend/src/routes/messages.js`
- Added `/api/messages/unread-notifications` endpoint
- Fetches unread messages with sender and product information
- Supports optional `limit` parameter (default: 20)
- Returns formatted data suitable for notifications

```javascript
router.get('/unread-notifications', [authenticateToken], async (req, res) => {
  // Fetches unread messages with proper includes
  // Transforms data into notification format
});
```

### 2. Frontend API Service Update
**File**: `frontend/src/services/api.ts`
- Added `getUnreadNotifications(limit?: number)` method to `messagesAPI`
- Calls the new backend endpoint with optional limit parameter

### 3. NotificationContext Enhancement
**File**: `frontend/src/contexts/NotificationContext.tsx`
- Enhanced the authentication effect to fetch existing unread messages
- Converts unread messages into notification objects
- Prevents duplicate notifications by checking existing IDs
- Added proper error handling and logging
- Only fetches when user is authenticated and has a valid user ID

## Key Features of the Fix

### 1. Duplicate Prevention
- Checks existing notification IDs before adding new ones
- Uses `unread_msg_${message.id}` prefix for unread message notifications
- Maintains notification limit (50 total)

### 2. Error Handling
- Graceful error handling that doesn't break the app
- Console logging for debugging
- Safe navigation with optional chaining (`message.sender?.companyName`)

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Only fetches last 10 unread messages by default
- Only runs when user is properly authenticated
- Prevents unnecessary API calls

### 4. User Experience
- Notifications appear immediately after sign-in
- Consistent notification format with real-time messages
- Proper navigation to conversation when clicked

## Testing
The fix has been implemented and tested with:
- ✅ Backend API endpoint responding correctly
- ✅ Frontend API service integration
- ✅ NotificationContext loading unread messages on authentication
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ Proper error handling and edge cases

## Files Modified
1. `backend/src/routes/messages.js` - Added unread-notifications endpoint
2. `frontend/src/services/api.ts` - Added getUnreadNotifications method
3. `frontend/src/contexts/NotificationContext.tsx` - Enhanced to fetch unread messages on sign-in

## Usage
Users will now see unread messages in their notification dropdown immediately after signing in, providing a complete notification experience that includes both existing unread messages and real-time notifications.
