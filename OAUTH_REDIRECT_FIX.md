# Google OAuth Redirect Fix

## Problem
The Google OAuth login was returning JSON data instead of redirecting users to the application after successful authentication. Users would see raw JSON response instead of being seamlessly signed in.

## Solution
Modified the OAuth flow to redirect users to the frontend application with authentication data, providing a seamless user experience.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

1. **Modified `authController.js`**:
   - Updated `googleCallback` function to redirect to frontend instead of returning JSON
   - Added proper error handling with redirects to login page
   - Authentication data is now passed as URL parameter to frontend

### Frontend Changes

1. **Created `OAuthCallbackPage.tsx`**:
   - New dedicated page to handle OAuth callback redirects
   - Processes authentication data from URL parameters
   - Provides loading states and error handling
   - Automatically redirects to dashboard on success or login page on error

2. **Updated `App.tsx`**:
   - Added new route `/auth/google/callback` for OAuth callback handling
   - Imported the new OAuthCallbackPage component

3. **Updated `GoogleOAuthButton.tsx`**:
   - Removed callback handling logic since it's now handled by dedicated route
   - Simplified the component to focus only on initiating OAuth flow

## Flow Description

1. User clicks "Continue with Google" button
2. Frontend requests OAuth URL from backend
3. User is redirected to Google OAuth consent screen
4. After consent, Google redirects to backend callback endpoint
5. Backend processes OAuth response and redirects to frontend with auth data
6. Frontend OAuth callback page processes auth data and signs user in
7. User is automatically redirected to dashboard

## Environment Variables

Ensure these environment variables are set:

```env
FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:3000"  # Frontend application URL
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-google-client-id"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-google-client-secret"
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI="http://localhost:5000/api/auth/google/callback"
```

## Testing

1. Start both backend and frontend servers
2. Navigate to the login page
3. Click "Continue with Google"
4. Complete Google OAuth flow
5. Verify you are automatically redirected to the dashboard and signed in

## Security Notes

- Authentication data is passed via URL parameters (base64 encoded JSON)
- Consider implementing a more secure method for production (e.g., temporary tokens)
- Ensure HTTPS is used in production for secure OAuth flow

## Benefits

- Seamless user experience with automatic redirects
- No more raw JSON responses shown to users
- Proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Clean separation of concerns between OAuth initiation and callback handling
