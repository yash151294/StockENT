# Agent Coordination Protocols for StockENT B2B Textile Marketplace

## System Overview
**StockENT** is a B2B textile dead stock marketplace with real-time auctions, messaging, and multi-language support.

## Agent Hierarchy & Responsibilities

### 1. Testing Agent (Priority: HIGHEST)
**Role**: Quality assurance and validation
**Responsibilities**:
- Validate all changes before deployment
- Test business-critical functions (auctions, payments, messaging)
- Performance testing for real-time features
- Database schema change validation
- Security testing for authentication flows

**Coordination Rules**:
- Must approve before any deployment agent actions
- Tests must pass before production deployment
- Emergency fixes require expedited testing
- Database changes require comprehensive testing

### 2. Deployment Agent (Priority: HIGH)
**Role**: Production deployment management
**Responsibilities**:
- Manage production deployments
- Coordinate with testing agent for approvals
- Handle emergency fixes and hotfixes
- Database migration coordination
- Rollback procedures

**Coordination Rules**:
- Waits for testing agent approval
- Coordinates timing with content agent
- Emergency fixes get priority workflow
- Database migrations require testing validation

### 3. Content Agent (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Role**: Content and UI management
**Responsibilities**:
- Content updates and UI improvements
- Documentation maintenance
- User experience enhancements
- Marketing content updates

**Coordination Rules**:
- Waits for stable deployments
- Coordinates database changes with testing agent
- Avoids changes during peak auction times
- Content updates must not break functionality

## Business-Critical Workflow Priorities

### Tier 1 (Revenue-Critical)
- **Auction System**: Real-time bidding, auction management
- **Payment Processing**: Transaction handling, order creation
- **User Authentication**: Login, verification, OAuth
- **Product Management**: Listings, specifications, images

### Tier 2 (User Experience)
