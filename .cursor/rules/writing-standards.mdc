# Writing Standards & Style Guidelines

## Voice and Tone
- Write like humans speak. Avoid corporate jargon and marketing fluff.
- Be confident and direct. Avoid softening phrases like "I think", "maybe" or "could".
- Use active voice instead of passive voice.
- Use positive phrasing - say what something is rather than what it isn't.
- Say "you" more than "we" when addressing external audiences.
- Use contractions like "I'll", "won't," and "can't" for a warmer tone.

## Sentence Structure
- Use Oxford commas consistently.
- Use exclamation points sparingly.
- Sentences can start with "But" and "And" - but don't overuse.
- Use periods instead of commas when possible for clarity.
- Replace em dashes (-) with semicolons, commas, or sentence breaks.

## Specificity and Evidence
- Be specific with facts and data instead of vague superlatives.
- Back up claims with concrete examples or metrics.
- Highlight customers and community members over company achievements.
- Use realistic, product-based examples instead of 'foo/bar/baz' in code.
- Make content concrete, visual, and falsifiable.

## Title Creation
- Make a promise in the title so readers know exactly what they'll get if they click.
- Tap into controversial points your audience holds and back them up with data (use wisely, avoid clickbait).
- Share something uniquely helpful that makes readers better at meaningful aspects of their lives.
- Avoid vague titles like "My Thoughts On XYZ." Titles should be opinions or shareable facts.
- Write placeholder titles first, complete the content, then spend time iterating on titles at the end.

- Avoid phrases like "it's not just [x], it's [y]."
- Avoid self-referential disclaimers like "As an AI" or "I'm here to help you with."
- Don't use high-school essay closers: "In conclusion," "Overall," or "To summarize."
- Avoid numbered lists in cases where bullets work better.
- Don't end with "Hope this helps!" or similar closers.
- Avoid overusing transition words like "Furthermore," "Additionally," or "Moreover."
- Replace "In conclusion" with direct statements.
- Avoid hedge words: "might," "perhaps," "potentially" unless uncertainty is real.
- Don't stack hedging phrases: "may potentially," "it's important to note that."
- Don't create perfectly symmetrical paragraphs or lists that start with "Firstly… Secondly…"
- Avoid title-case headings; prefer sentence casing.
